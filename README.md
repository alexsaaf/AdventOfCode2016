# AdventOfCode
These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2016](http://adventofcode.com/). I decided to use C# as I had been using it for Unity development but nothing else, and I wanted to get some more varied experience with it.
I didn't manage to finish all tasks in time, and as a result of new courses starting I have still not had the time to finish the last tasks.
